# What

This is a simple template for writing OpenCL kernels and running them. I made this program only because of how damn hard it's to get OpenCL working on the dozen different Linux systems and it was too hard to test basic OpenCL operations with my main program. This simple template is what I use for trying new things with OpenCL and verifying that the code works on all my machines and GPUs.

# License

I copied some of the code from elsewhere, mostly blogs and AMD docs. Do whatever you wish, but know that it's not all mine.
